    <p>Hello everyone my name is Kayla Macias. I am a freshman at Utah Valley University and I love photography. I'm not only interested in taking portraits but also landscapes, events, and night skies. At the moment taking photos and capturing moments are only a hobby of mine because in addition to this I want to do web design's. Hopefully I can combine the two in the future because they are both quite amazing to do.</p>
    
    <p>I never liked taking photo's of myself ever since I was little or so I was told. When I came of age when I wanted to look back at the memories of growing up I wasn't able to. I then told myself at seventeen that I was going to capture every moment I possibly can from there on out. In 11th grade I took a Digital Design course and there I was handed my first DSLR camera to use and I loved it. Just being able to capture little moments in life gives me happiness and relief that I be able to look back at those days.</p>
    
    <p>Overall I don't want anyone to not have a photo they can't look back at. Photo's are what takes up back in time and helps us relive that moment even if it's just for a second. I hope that you can give me the opportunity to capture those little moments in life so you can cherish them forever!</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Kayla Macias</p>
