    <p>I hope to one day be able to take photos like <a href="https://www.amyandjordan.com/blog/" target="_blank">Amy and Jordan</a> who take bridal photos with a beautiful highkey lighting. In addition to them I also want to be like <a href="https://www.rleintzphotography.com/blog" target="_blank">Rachel Leintz</a> who takes lowkey lighting photos that show emotion color and beauty as well a mystery.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Highkey and Lowkey?</h2>
    <dl>
    
    <dt>Highkey</dt>
    <dd>High key photography uses unnaturally bright lighting to blow out most or all harsh shadows in an image.</dd>
    
    <dt>Lowkey</dt>
    <dd>A low-key image is one that contains predominantly dark tones and colours. Like high-key images, they convey atmosphere and mood</dd>

    <!-- this paragraph let readers know how I came across landscape photography --> 
    <h2 id="landscapes">How I got into landscape photos</h2>
    <p >I got into landscape photogrpahy when I first came to utah back in 2009. One day I had went to see a waterfall called Bridal Veil Falls, I wanted to capture the beauty of the waterfalling and the success I had of reaching the top of the falls. Unfortunatley I didn't own a camera then but a ipod, I knew then that once a get a camera I would want to capture every adventure I go on. So far Ive been able to improve my photography and <a href="my-work/landscapes.html">here's</a> what I gotten so far. </p>
